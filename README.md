# NLP models
These are a couple of NLP models coded in PyTorch and PyTorch Lighning. 
I coded these models to learn and to show some implementations of PyTorch lightning.

I'm going to be using the FashionMNIST dataset to train a classifyer using theses architectures.

## Available models
* Simple RNN: available in [script](models/simple_rnn.py) or in [notebook](notebooks/simple_rnn.ipynb)
* Simple LSTM/GRU: coming soon
* seq2seq: coming soon
* seq2seq with attention: coming soon
* Not sure
