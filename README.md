# RNN models
These are a couple of RNN models coded in PyTorch and PyTorch Lighning. 
I coded these models to learn and to show some implementations of PyTorch lightning.

I'm going to be using the FashionMNIST dataset to train a classifyer using theses architectures. 
These simple architectures won't yield any good results.

## Available models
* Simple RNN: available in [script](models/simple_rnn.py) or in [notebook](notebooks/simple_rnn.ipynb)
* Simple LSTM/GRU: available in [script](models/simple_lstm.py) or in [notebook](notebooks/simple_gru_lstm.ipynb) 
* seq2seq: coming soon
* seq2seq with attention: coming soon
